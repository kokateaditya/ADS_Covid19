*******Enterprise Data Science - COVID-19 Data Prototype*******


Name : Aditya Kundalik Kokate			Mt. No. : 419334


In this prototype, COVID-19 dataset has been analysed. This code presents the static visualization of covid situation over the Germany, India, and Italy.
It is always better to analyse the data in the graphical way.

This prototype give static visualization for:
	1. Relative COVID-19 cases
	2. Vacination rate
(Figures has been uploaded to the OLAT personal folder)

# Instructions to run the code - 
	a. Please clone the repository from above link to local machine
	b. Go to "notbooks" folder and open the file "Task_1.ipynb" into the Jupyter Notebook.
	c. Run the code by using "Kernel > Restart & Run All".
	d. Results can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook and plots will be exported in the folder.
